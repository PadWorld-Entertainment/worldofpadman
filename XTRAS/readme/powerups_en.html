						<b><u>Health and Shield</u></b>
						<br /><br />

						<p style="min-height: 220px">
							<b>Loading Station</b>
							<br /><br />
							<img
								class="readme_image"
								style="float: left"
								src="pictures/health.jpg"
								alt=""
							/>
							There are no health points to collect in WoP.
							Instead of walking over items, you must stand on a
							loading station, also known as a health station. As
							long as you stand on the loading station, your
							health will regenerate. Of course, this only works
							until you have 100% health, at which point you will
							get a message that you are fully charged. The
							stations also do not have an infinite amount of
							energy. The size of the crosses indicates how much
							energy a station has left. If a station is empty, it
							will take a minute for it to recharge and be ready.
						</p>

						<p style="min-height: 175px">
							<b>PadShield</b>
							<br /><br />
							<img
								class="readme_image"
								style="float: left"
								src="pictures/shield.jpg"
								alt=""
							/>
							This item gives you 100% shield energy at once!
						</p>

						<p style="min-height: 175px">
							<b>PadShard</b>
							<br /><br />
							<img
								class="readme_image"
								style="float: left"
								src="pictures/shard.jpg"
								alt=""
							/>
							Collecting PadShards gives you 5 points of shield
							energy. The nice thing about PadShards is that you
							can collect them even if you already have 100%
							shield energy. You will still receive 5 shield
							energy points as long as you have not reached 200%.
						</p>

						<b><u>Powerups</u></b>
						<br /><br />

						<p style="min-height: 165px">
							<img
								class="readme_image"
								style="float: left"
								src="pictures/padpower.jpg"
								alt=""
							/>
							<b>PADPOWER</b>
							<br /><br />
							This is a mix of power and protection. If you have
							PADPOWER, you should go hunting for enemies as
							quickly as possible, as in addition to the increased
							damage you deal, you are also somewhat protected
							from the damage your enemies can deal to you. As a
							bonus, you are also protected from damage from your
							own weapons, so jumping with Betty or Imperius will
							not have any major consequences.
						</p>

						<p style="min-height: 165px">
							<img
								class="readme_image"
								style="float: left"
								src="pictures/revival.jpg"
								alt=""
							/>
							<b>REViVAL</b>
							<br /><br />
							This will not make you immortal, but your health
							will automatically regenerate until you reach 200%.
						</p>

						<p style="min-height: 165px">
							<img
								class="readme_image"
								style="float: left"
								src="pictures/jumper.jpg"
								alt=""
							/>
							<b>JUMPER</b>
							<br /><br />
							Jump like a bunny! This power-up allows you to jump
							three times higher than normal. Not only does this
							allow you to reach places that would otherwise be
							inaccessible, but the constant bouncing makes you a
							difficult target for your opponents.
						</p>

						<p style="min-height: 165px">
							<img
								class="readme_image"
								style="float: left"
								src="pictures/visionless.jpg"
								alt=""
							/>
							<b>ViSiONLESS</b>
							<br /><br />
							Being able to hunt enemies invisibly is a great
							thing, and ViSiONLESS makes it possible. It doesn't
							make you 100% invisible, though, as you'll still see
							a slight veil if you look closely. Still, you can
							usually use it to safely enter the teleporter or
							steal a lollipop without being noticed.
						</p>

						<p style="min-height: 165px">
							<img
								class="readme_image"
								style="float: left"
								src="pictures/speedy.jpg"
								alt=""
							/>
							<b>SPEEDY</b>
							<br /><br />
							It's amazing how fast you can be. With this
							power-up, you can run many times faster, not only
							catching up with your opponent, but also making
							escape a breeze. But beware, the altered curvature
							of space is not for the faint-hearted.
						</p>

						<p style="min-height: 200px">
							<img
								class="readme_image"
								style="float: left"
								src="pictures/puppetmaster.jpg"
								alt=""
							/>
							<b>PuppetMaster</b>
							<br /><br />
							If you manage to make 5 frags with PUNCHY, you will
							become the PuppetMaster in WoP for 30 seconds. In
							this state, you are faster than your opponents,
							almost invulnerable, and Punchy deals even more
							damage. As a PuppetMaster, you are feared and can go
							hunting for enemies with a relaxed attitude.
						</p>

						<b><u>Holdables</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						<p>
							Note: Holdables must be activated using the Use
							button. The default is 'E' or 'Enter'.
						</p>
						<p style="min-height: 165px">
							<img
								class="readme_image"
								style="float: left"
								src="pictures/floater.jpg"
								alt=""
							/>
							<b>FLOATER</b>
							<br /><br />
							This is how you take off. You can fly the FLOATER
							for as long as you have fuel. Once you have
							collected the item, a fuel meter will appear on the
							right-hand side of the screen. You can use it to
							take off for up to 8 seconds at a time.
						</p>

						<p style="min-height: 165px">
							<img
								class="readme_image"
								style="float: left"
								src="pictures/killerducks.jpg"
								alt=""
							/>
							<b>KiLLERDUCKS</b><br /><br />
							You can unleash these nasty beasts on your
							opponents. Once you have collected them, you can
							send them off one at a time by pressing the use
							button. The ducklings will automatically search for
							a nearby victim to attack and won't let go so
							easily. But be careful: if there is no enemy nearby,
							the squeaky ducks will sometimes attack the owner!
						</p>

						<p style="min-height: 165px">
							<img
								class="readme_image"
								style="float: left"
								src="pictures/boomies.jpg"
								alt=""
							/>
							<b>BOOMiES</b><br /><br />
							Small but mighty is how you could describe these
							mines. Collecting this item will give you three
							limpet mines to place around the map. You won't be
							able to lay entire minefields with them, of course,
							but as defensive equipment, these mines will explode
							when an enemy approaches, causing a lot of damage.
							But because they are so dangerous, there are places
							on the map where they cannot be laid.

							<img
								class="readme_image"
								style="float: left"
								src="pictures/bambam.jpg"
								alt=""
							/>
							<b>BAMBAM</b><br /><br />
							The BAMBAM is a turret that automatically fires at
							the enemy as soon as it comes within range. It can
							also be disabled by firing enough shots at it. As
							this is a very powerful item, it cannot be placed
							anywhere on the map.
