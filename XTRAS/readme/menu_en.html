					<p style="min-height: 230px">
						<b><u>Main menu</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						<img style="float: left" class="readme_image" alt="" src="pictures/main.jpg" /><br />
						From here you can access all the important areas.
						And the best part is, it all works! And if you're
						looking for something, you might even find a few
						extras!
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 230px">
						<b><u>Create</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						<img style="float: left" class="readme_image" alt="" src="pictures/create.jpg" /><br />
						Here you have the option to start a server: very
						important, especially for offline players and LAN
						fetishists. The great thing about our menu is that
						you can not only select a map, but also create a map
						list. Just click on all the maps you want to play.
						The order will be displayed and if you make a
						mistake, you can remove a map from the list by
						clicking on it again. As a little teaser, you can
						see a small slideshow with screenshots of the
						current map when you select it. At the bottom of the
						screen you can easily select the game mode. However,
						you should do this before (!) setting the order of
						the maps.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 230px">
						<b><u>Select Bots</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						<img style="float: left" class="readme_image" alt="" src="pictures/bots.jpg" /><br />
						After clicking on Select Bots in the Create menu,
						you have landed here. Here you can select bots for a
						game and easily add several at once. Simply click on
						the desired images and the selected bots will appear
						in the list on the right. If you want to remove a
						bot, click on its name in the list and it will
						disappear. In the team game modes, you can assign
						the bots to blue or red by clicking on the team
						color. In all other game modes, you can freely
						choose the blue or red skin in addition to the
						default skin. You can set the difficulty level of
						the bots at the bottom.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 230px">
						<b><u>Player</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						<img style="float: left" class="readme_image" alt="" src="pictures/player.jpg" /><br />
						Click Setup -> Player to access the menu for
						selecting the model, skin, name, and logo. The
						available models are listed at the top of the
						screen. Select one and click on it. Now move to the
						right side of the screen. Here you will find the
						skins you can choose for the model you have
						selected. Depending on the model, you may have more
						or fewer skins to choose from.
						<br />
						To take a closer look at a model, simply click and
						hold on the 3D model in the center. The model can
						now be rotated by moving the mouse. You can also see
						how the models look with different weapons by
						clicking on the weapon change buttons.
						<br />
						In the left part of the menu there is space for your
						name (not much space, but it should be enough). Use
						the arrows below to select your logo for the Spray
						Your Color game mode, the color selection below
						determines the color of the logo or the iNjECTOR
						trail if InstaPad is activated. If you can't decide,
						you can also use the Random Color option to select a
						random color for each shot. Of course, this only
						works if no team game mode is active.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 230px">
						<b><u>Options</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						<img style="float: left" class="readme_image" alt="" src="pictures/options.jpg" /><br />
						You can access this in the menu via Setup ->
						Options. In addition to several game options that
						you can set here, the crosshairs and the HUD design
						on the HUD menu page are particularly interesting.
						The crosshair can be selected by clicking on it
						until the desired design appears. The HUD theme is
						selected from a list. Clicking on Color/Theme will
						bring up all available designs for you to choose
						from. These changes will be applied and displayed
						in-game immediately, unless a team game mode is
						active.
						<br />
						On the Help menu page, you can also toggle some
						useful wallhack icons. Depending on the game mode,
						these will direct you to various important
						destinations.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 230px">
						<b><u>Music menu (in-game)</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						<img style="float: left" class="readme_image" alt="" src="pictures/music.jpg" /><br />
						Our musical jewel is the in-game jukebox, which is
						filled with songs, some of which were composed
						especially for our game. You can access the menu by
						defining a key for it in the menu under Setup ->
						Controls -> Misc. The default is 'M'. All available
						tracks are listed on the LP cover that appears and
						can simply be clicked to play. It is also possible
						to create a track list by clicking on the desired
						tracks in the desired order.
						<br />
						Since there is more than one LP, you can also switch
						between them using the switch button. Of course, the
						playlist you create can also contain tracks from
						different LPs.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 230px">
						<b><u>Vote menu (in-game)</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						<img style="float: left" class="readme_image" alt="" src="pictures/vote.jpg" /><br />
						Playing on a server but want to change the map or
						don't like the game mode? Just ask your fellow
						players if they want to change too. You can easily
						start a vote in WoP from the in-game menu by
						pressing the Escape key and then simply clicking on
						Call Vote. In the upper area you can choose what you
						want to vote on, e.g. map or game mode, in the lower
						area you will see a list with the maps, game modes
						etc. that are available for voting.
						<br />
						After voting, all you have to do is wait and see if
						the other players agree with the change or not. To
						do this, they have to press 'F1' (yes) or 'F2' (no),
						if not set otherwise, or they have to go to the
						voting menu themselves, where the options yes or no
						are now displayed.
