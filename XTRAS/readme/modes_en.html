						<b><u>Spray Your Color (SYC)</u></b>
						<br /><img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/teleporter.jpg" alt="" />
						<br />
						The game works as follows: You must shoot your
						opponent and then take a color cartridge from him.
						You can collect up to eight color cartridges. If you
						have one or more color cartridges, you can use a
						special teleporter that does not work without color
						cartridges. This teleporter will take you to a room
						called the Spray Room, where you will find two spray
						walls on which you can spray your logos. Once you
						teleport into the spray room, you automatically
						receive a spray gun and cannot use any weapons. The
						spray room is also a neutral zone, at least for a
						certain amount of time. If you stay in the spray
						room too long, the map will creatively send you to
						the afterlife. ;)
						<br />Once you have sprayed your logos on the wall
						for points, you will return to the main area of the
						map, where you can fight for more color
						cartridges.<br />
						If you see a color cartridge that belongs to your
						team, you can neutralize it by running over it so
						that the opponent cannot collect it. In FFA mode, it
						is not possible to collect or neutralize your own
						color cartridges. That's bad luck. However, you
						don't have to worry about which spray wall is the
						right one to use when spraying, as both are
						available to you in FFA mode. In team mode, however,
						the right color is crucial.
						<br />To avoid having to walk around for hours to
						find the teleporter, there is an icon (can be
						disabled in the Setup -> Options -> Help menu) that
						is visible even through walls, provided you have
						collected at least one color cartridge. This shows
						you the location of the teleporter.<br /><br />
						Scoring:<br />
						For each sprayed logo, your own team gets 5 points.
						In FFA mode the points go to your own account. If
						you manage to spray 5 logos in a row without leaving
						the room, you get a bonus of 10 points
						(SprayKiller). If you manage to spray 8 logos in a
						row, you get an extra 25 points (SprayGod).<br />
						<br />
						Examples:<br />
						3 logos: 3 * 5 points = 15 points <br />
						6 logos: 6 * 5 points = 30 points + 10 bonus points
						= 40 points<br />
						8 logos: 8 * 5 points = 40 points + 10 bonus points
						+ 25 bonus points = 75 points

						<b><u>Big Balloon (BB)</u></b>
						<br /><img class="readme_image" style="float: right" src="pictures/balloon.jpg" alt="" />
						<br />
						Big Balloon is similar to Domination in Unreal
						Tournament, except that it involves crates, each
						containing a balloon that rises when you stop near
						the crate. There are three crates on the map. When
						you approach one of the crates, a balloon of your
						team's color will rise. However, it takes 10 seconds
						for the balloon to rise, and points are only awarded
						when the balloon is at the top. If you want a
						balloon to rise faster, simply gather several
						players of the same team around the balloon. The
						longer the balloon stays up or the more balloons of
						your team's color light up, the more points you
						score. If an opposing player touches the balloon for
						5 seconds, the balloon will burst and a new balloon
						of the opposing team's color will rise.<br />
						To avoid running around for hours to find the
						balloons, there is an icon (can be disabled in the
						menu under Setup -> Options -> Help) that is also
						visible through walls. It shows the position of the
						balloons and which team has just captured a balloon.
						<br /><br />
						Scoring:<br />
						The team scores one point every 2 seconds for each
						balloon in its own team color. If all three balloons
						are held by the same team, the points are doubled.
						The team gets 2 points per balloon every 2 seconds,
						so 6 points in 2 seconds.
						<br /><br />
						Personal bonus points:
						<br />5 points for raising a balloon <br />1 point
						for bursting an opponent's balloon <br />1 point for
						defending a balloon of your color <br />2 points for
						helping a balloon rise faster

						<b><u>Capture The Lolly (CTL)</u></b>
						<br /><img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/lollies.jpg" alt="" />
						<br />
						The justifiably popular game mode Capture The Flag
						has found its way into WoP as Capture The Lolly.
						Instead of capturing flags, the focus is on
						capturing sweet lollipops. The game is played in two
						teams, each trying to infiltrate the other team's
						base and steal the lolly. If they succeed, they must
						bring the lollipop back to their own base to deliver
						to their own lollipop. It is important to note that
						you only score points if your own lollipop is in the
						base. If it is not, your own lolly must first be
						recaptured by taking out the opponent's lolly
						carrier and your own team running over the lolly.
						The lolly will then reappear in your base and does
						not need to be carried back. The goal is to both
						steal the other team's lolly and protect your own
						lolly in order to score points. Only the team that
						works well together will be successful.
						<br /><br />
						Personal bonus points:
						<br />5 points for capturing and delivering the
						lolly<br />1 point for bringing the lolly back to
						your base; 1 additional point if a team member
						immediately brings the opponent's lolly to your base
						<br />2 points for shooting down the enemy lolly
						carrier; 2 additional points if a team member
						immediately brings the opponent's lolly to your base
						<br />1 point for defending your own lolly carrier;
						1 additional point for taking out the opponent who
						last attacked or hit your own lolly carrier<br />1
						point for defending your own lolly
					</p>

					<p>
						<br />
						<b><u>One Lolly Capture (1LC)</u></b>
						<br />
						<br />
						This game mode modifies Capture The Lolly so that
						there is only one neutral lollipop in the center of
						the map, which each team must pick up and place in
						the opposing team's base, where the opposing team's
						lollipop is located. The colored lollipops cannot be
						picked up or stolen. One Lolly Capture is therefore
						a slightly faster game, as you do not have to run
						all the way to the other team's base and back.
						Depending on which team gets to the neutral lolly
						first, one team becomes the attacker, while the
						other team has to defend its base. Of course, good
						teamwork is essential here as well!
						<br /><br />
						Personal bonus points:
						<br />points for capturing and delivering the
						lolly<br />2 points for shooting down the enemy
						lolly carrier<br />1 point for defending your own
						lolly carrier; 1 additional point for taking out the
						opponent who last attacked or hit your own lolly
						carrier<br />1 point for defending your own lollipop
						in the base

						<b><u>Last Pad Standing (LPS)</u></b>
						<br /><img class="readme_image" style="float: right" src="pictures/lpswallhack.jpg" alt="" />
						<br />
						Last Pad Standing is our take on the popular Last
						Man Standing game mode. Each player has a certain
						number of virtual lives and is eliminated when all
						of his or her lives are used up. The last player
						standing wins the game.
						<br />
						Since this game mode invites you to hide and wait
						for your fellow players to make life difficult for
						each other, we have added a corresponding icon
						(which can be turned off in the menu under Setup ->
						Options -> Help) that floats above the players'
						heads and is also visible through walls. This makes
						it very difficult to hide. To make it even more
						exciting, the leading player is shown with a red
						symbol and should therefore be at the top of the
						list. If more than one player is in that position at
						the same time, they will all be marked with a red
						symbol.
					</p>

					<p>
						<br />
						<b><u>Freeze Tag (FT)</u></b>
						<br />
						<br />
						This game mode is a classic and should not be
						missing in WoP. The goal is to freeze the opposing
						team with an arsenal of icy weapons as quickly and
						completely as possible. But be careful, players on
						the same team can help each other out and unfreeze
						each other as long as they are not frozen
						themselves. To help you find your frozen teammates,
						we have added an icon (which can be turned off in
						the Setup -> Options -> Help menu) that floats above
						the players' heads and is also visible through
						walls.
						<br /><br />
						Personal bonus points:
						<br />1 point for freezing an opposing player<br />1
						point for unfreezing a player from your team
					</p>

						<br />
						<b><u>Catch The KillerDuck (CTKD)</u></b>
						<br />
						<br />
						Everything here revolves around the golden
						KillerDuck, as points are only awarded for
						collecting and holding the prestigious duck. It is
						located somewhere on the map, marked by a golden
						symbol (can be turned off in the menu under Setup ->
						Options -> Help), which is also visible through
						walls. If you collect it, you suddenly become the
						hunted and are not allowed to shoot or pick up
						weapons. This also applies to ammunition. On the
						other hand, you gain more speed and jumping power to
						escape your hunters as fast as possible. Of course,
						you can still use power-ups, except for the
						holdables. While the hunters can't hurt each other,
						you are now vulnerable, which is why the duck gives
						you 200% health and shield energy when you pick it
						up.
						<br />
						If you think you can hide somewhere with the duck
						and have a lazy day, think again. The duck quacks
						all the time, and the little cloud of points that
						rises above you every three seconds can be seen from
						anywhere on the map, even through walls.

						<b><u>InstaPad</u></b>
						<br /><img class="readme_image" style="float: right" src="pictures/injector.jpg" alt="" />
						<br />
						InstaPad is not a specific game mode, but rather a
						kind of mutator that can be added to any of the
						game's modes from the menu. When InstaPad is
						selected, all weapons and ammo packs are removed
						from the maps and players are equipped with the
						iNjECTOR and infinite ammo from the start of a
						round. The iNjECTOR works in a similar way to the
						SPLASHER, meaning it has a slow rate of fire, but
						incredible penetrating power. One hit is usually
						enough to defeat the enemy instantly.
						<br />In addition, the weapon is equipped with a
						special zoom that causes enemy Pads to light up.
						InstaPad is for fans of precise aiming and fast
						gameplay.
