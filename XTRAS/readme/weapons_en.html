						<b><u>PUNCHY</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						This puppet has it all: it bites and deals a lot of
						damage. Not only is Punchy a good choice when
						ammunition is low, but it also makes you run a
						little faster, making it easier to escape - or to
						attack. If you get 5 strikes in a round with Punchy,
						you will also become the PuppetMaster, virtually
						invulnerable and able to make life even harder for
						your opponents for 30 seconds.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 130px">
						<img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/nipper.jpg" alt="" />
						<b><u>NiPPER</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						This little guy, also known as the NiPPER, is the
						starting weapon and basically works like a pistol.
						However, it shoots faster the faster you press the
						mouse button.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 130px">
						<img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/pumper.jpg" alt="" />
						<b><u>PUMPER</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						PUMPER is a double-barrelled spray gun that packs a
						punch. With its lightning bolts at the end of the
						jet, it can also inflict damage on nearby enemies.
						However, its range is limited.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 130px">
						<img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/bubbleg.jpg" alt="" />
						<b><u>BUBBLE G.</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						Now it's time to get colorful. The BUBBLE G. (Bubble
						Gun) shoots different colored balls in quick
						succession, which can be a real pain, but also makes
						the map really colorful.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 130px">
						<img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/balloony.jpg" alt="" />
						<b><u>BALLOONY</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						This weapon is unpredictable. With its water bombs
						bouncing around wildly, it is quite difficult to get
						a good shot with the BALLOONY. The upside is that
						the bombs do a lot of damage and you can take out
						your opponent pretty quickly.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 130px">
						<img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/splasher.jpg" alt="" />
						<b><u>SPLASHER</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						Every self-respecting game has a sniper rifle. In
						WoP there is the SPLASHER. With its variable zoom,
						it is perfect for medium to long range. One
						disadvantage: The rate of fire is very slow.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 130px">
						<img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/boaster.jpg" alt="" />
						<b><u>BOASTER</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						A truly crazy weapon. It does a lot of damage with
						its curved water jet. What's more, anything the
						BOASTER hits becomes slippery as hell, so you can
						make your opponent nearly unable to maneuver, making
						them easy prey.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 130px">
						<img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/betty.jpg" alt="" />
						<b><u>BETTY</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						The BOOM-BOOM BETTY creates space in the ring with
						its large fireballs. It is important to note that
						the fireballs do not fly very fast and are therefore
						recommended for medium distances.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 130px">
						<img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/imperius.jpg" alt="" />
						<b><u>iMPERiUS</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						If you see a purple star, run. With its
						all-destroying explosion, the iMPERiUS is simply
						more powerful than any other weapon. But it also has
						two drawbacks. With a maximum of only three shots,
						it's not very well-equipped, and it takes a while to
						reload. When it is loaded, it beeps and you have to
						let go of the trigger to avoid being vaporized. It
						also shakes while loading, which makes aiming
						difficult.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 130px">
						<img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/injector.jpg" alt="" />
						<b><u>iNjECTOR</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						A very special weapon, so special that you won't see
						it lying around on the maps. The iNjECTOR is our
						special weapon for InstaPad and works in a similar
						way to the SPLASHER, meaning it has a low rate of
						fire but is extra powerful. It also has a zoom that
						makes enemies glow in your field of vision.
