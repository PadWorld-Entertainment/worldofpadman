						<b><u>Bot support</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						World of PADMAN offers full bot support for all game
						modes! Offline players will be happy to play Spray
						Your Color, Big Balloon, Last Pad Standing, Capture
						the Lolly and many more with bots. The bot support
						works quite well and the maps have been optimized
						for bots.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b><u>Dropping items</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						Have you collected a bunch of color cartridges and
						don't think you'll make it to the teleporter? Want
						to give your teammate a color cartridge so they can
						earn extra points for the team with SprayGod or
						SprayKiller? For such cases, you can define a drop
						button in the menu under Setup -> Controls -> Move.
						The defaults are 'F' and 'Backspace'. This feature
						works not only in the team version of Spray Your
						Color, but also in Capture The Lolly and One Lolly
						Capture. Here you can pass the lolly to other
						players. In Catch The KillerDuck you can quickly get
						rid of the duck if it gets too much for you.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b><u>Glow Skins</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						In serious tournaments it is important to recognize
						your opponent quickly. For this reason, WoP offers
						the option to activate glow skins in the Setup ->
						Options -> Game menu. If you do this, the models of
						your opponents will get a glowing skin in a color of
						your choice, so that they stand out clearly from the
						game world. This option is certainly a plus for
						clans and action-packed 1v1 battles, but not for the
						overall graphical concept ;) In the team game modes,
						the colors are always set to red and blue.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b><u>Voice-Chat</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						Gone are the days when you had to torture your
						keyboard, because World of PADMAN has a voice chat
						system. This must be activated in the menu under
						Setup -> System -> Net/VoIP. Then you can choose if
						your voice will be recognized and transmitted
						automatically or if you want to press a button to
						talk (push to talk), like with a walkie-talkie. If
						you choose push to talk, you can define a button for
						it in the menu under Setup -> Controls -> Chat. The
						default is 'R'.
						<br />
						In the game itself, you can also adjust the volume
						of individual players or mute them using the
						'Escape' key to enter the in-game menu. If you want
						to use Mumble as an external voice chat program, you
						can also select Mumble support in the menu.
					</p>

						<b><u>Warmup</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						The <i>g_WarmupReady</i> command can be used so that
						a game does not start immediately after loading, but
						only when a certain number of players have
						registered as ready to play with the
						<i>/ready</i> command. The server administrator can
						set the variable <i>g_WarmupReady</i> to a value
						between 0 and 1 in the server configuration, where
						<i>g_doWarmup</i> must also be set to 1. If
						<i>g_WarmupReady</i> is set to 0, this means that
						the game will start immediately. If it is 1, 100% of
						the players present must type <i>/ready</i> in the
						console. In addition, any other decimal number
						between 0 and 1 can be entered to force a certain
						percentage of players to be ready.<br /><br />
						<u>Examples:</u>
						<br /><br />
						set g_doWarmup 1<br />
						set g_WarmupReady 0.5 -> 50% must be ready to play
						<br /><br />
						or<br /><br />
						set g_doWarmup 1<br />
						set g_WarmupReady 0.8 -> 80% must be ready to
						play<br /><br />
						This command is especially recommended for Last Pad
						Standing and team-oriented game modes in general.
					</p>

						<b><u>Bugs</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						World of PADMAN has been in development for over 20
						years, but that doesn't mean it's bug-free. Like any
						self-respecting developer, we've intentionally
						included a few bugs to give you something to look
						for and get excited about. If you find bugs, send us
						an email so we can brag about a patch. ;) Better
						yet, report the bug directly on
						<a href="https://github.com/PadWorld-Entertainment/worldofpadman/issues"
							target="_blank">Github</a>
						by creating a ticket there.
