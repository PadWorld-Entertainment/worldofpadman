						<b><u>HUD designs</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						We have created a total of 10 HUD designs for you to
						choose from in the Setup -> Options -> HUD menu.
						Since we already explained on the menu page how the
						selection works, here is a nice copy'n'paste:
						<br />
						The HUD design is selected from a list. Clicking on
						Color/Theme will display all available designs for
						you to choose from. These changes will be applied
						and displayed in-game immediately, unless a team
						game mode is active. The HUD theme will then
						automatically be set to the team colors of blue or
						red.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b><u>Notifications (top left)</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						The notification area is located in the upper left
						corner of the HUD. This is where chat messages from
						other players are displayed. In the Setup -> Options
						-> Chat menu, you can set the display height (number
						of lines), the display time, and the size of the
						player image in front of the text. The larger the
						image, the larger the text. The image can also be
						turned off completely.
						<br />
						There is also an option to scale the text in the
						console if it is too small to read at high
						resolution.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 150px">
						<b><u>Server info (top right)</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						<img style="float: left" class="readme_image" alt="" src="pictures/server_hud_kl.jpg" />
						The server info is a small window in the top right
						corner of the HUD that displays things like the set
						point limit, match time, etc. A key to show or hide
						the info window can be assigned in the Setup ->
						Controls -> Misc menu. The default is 'K'.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 220px">
						<b><u>Weapon status and points (bottom left)</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						<img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/lefthud.jpg" alt="" />
						In the lower left corner of the HUD, you can see
						which weapon you have selected and how much ammo you
						have left for that weapon. This is also where the
						score is displayed, so you can see at a glance what
						your personal score is, or which team is ahead in
						the team game modes.<br />
						The yellow dot with the X in it always shows you
						which one is yours.
						<br /><br />
						<b>Catch The KillerDuck:</b> In this game mode,
						weapons and ammo are no longer usable and cannot be
						collected once the KillerDuck has been captured. The
						3D model or 2D icon will be replaced by the
						KillerDuck and the ammo meter will be removed.
					</p>

					<p style="min-height: 160px">
						<b><u>Health and shield energy (bottom center)</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						<img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/centerhud.jpg" alt="" />
						This is probably the most important part of the HUD.
						In the middle section at the bottom you can see your
						health to the left of your head and your shield
						energy to the right in the form of bars.<br />
						If the left part, the red area, is completely
						filled, you have 100% health. If you happen to have
						more than 100% health, e.g. due to the Revival
						power-up or respawning, you will see a corresponding
						part of the bar in dark red. The whole thing goes up
						to a maximum of 200%.
						<br />
						The same applies to the right part of the bar, the
						blue shield energy status. If you have more than
						100% shield energy, e.g. due to PadShield or
						PadShards, you will see a corresponding dark blue
						section. Again, the display goes up to a maximum of
						200%.<br />
						Again, the display goes up to a maximum of 200%. You
						can also display your health directly with the
						crosshair by activating the Indicate Health option
						in the Setup -> Options -> HUD menu. The crosshair
						will turn yellow and then red as your health
						decreases.
						<br /><br />
						<b>InstaPad:</b> If this area of the HUD flashes
						wildly for a few seconds at the start of the game,
						it is not a bug, but is intended to show you in
						InstaPad how long enemy hits cannot harm you after a
						respawn. During this time, you are protected and can
						find your way around the game.

						<b><u>Game mode info (bottom right)</u></b>
						<br /><br />
						<img class="readme_image" style="float: left" src="pictures/righthudsyc.jpg" alt="" /><img
							class="readme_image" style="float: right" src="pictures/righthudbb.jpg" alt="" />
						This area varies depending on the game mode. Nothing
						is displayed for Free For All (Team), Last Pad
						Standing, Freeze Tag, and Catch The KillerDuck.
						However, useful information is displayed for Spray
						Your Color (Team), Big Balloon, Capture The Lolly,
						and One Lolly Capture.
						<br /><br />
						<b>Spray Your Color</b>: The number of collected
						color cartridges is displayed here. Since the number
						of color cartridges is limited to eight, up to eight
						dots are displayed here. Each red dot represents a
						collected color cartridge. When you have collected
						at least one color cartridge, a 3D model or 2D icon
						appears, depending on your settings. <br /><br />
						<b>Big Balloon:</b> This shows which balloons are
						captured by which team. With a little practice, you
						can quickly figure out which balloon is where on the
						map. In addition, a small yellow bar shows how long
						you have to stay near a balloon before it fully
						rises or bursts.

						<br /><br />
						<b>Capture The Lolly:</b> This game mode shows the
						status of your lollipop, whether it is safe in your
						base (@), captured by your opponent (X), or lying
						somewhere on the map (?). If you have captured the
						lollipop yourself, a 3D model or 2D icon of the
						lollipop will appear, depending on your settings.
						<br /><br />
						<b>One Lolly Capture:</b> One Lolly Capture: In this
						game mode, the status of the neutral lollipop is
						indicated by white symbols at the lower position,
						i.e. whether it is in the middle of the map (@), has
						been captured (X), or is lying somewhere on the map
						(?). The red or blue @ symbol above the lollipop
						only appears if one of the teams currently has
						possession of the lollipop. If you picked up the
						lollipop yourself, you will see a 3D model or a 2D
						icon, depending on your settings.
