# Christmas Theme

This is the updated 2009 version of the 2008 World of Padman X-mas modification for World
of Padman 1.2. Most of the ingame items, powerups, healthstations etc. have been replaced
by a Christmas-themed version. The function of all items remains the same.
In this updated version every character also got one Christmas themed skin and some menus
have been edited. Bot support for the "Freezetag" mode has been added.

# Freezetag

Freezetag transforms Teamplay/TDM into... something not boring :P Players are not knocked
out and respawned but literally frozen in place, waiting to be "thawed" by a teammate.
To thaw a member of your team stand next to them until the "thaw-bar" fills up.
The team that first manages to freeze the entire opposing team wins the round.
