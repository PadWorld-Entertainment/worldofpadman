	- Missing PADMAN winner statue model (md3 file)
	- Jail: missing pressure scale textures
- CHANGED
	- PadGirl and PadBabe taunts, PadGirl now says "Don't call me babe!" and PadBabe now says "Eat this!" which makes more sense
	- Landing sound to play on all falls, no matter the height, the Pads always fall on their feeds without taking damage
	- KillerDuck pickup lock time beyond respawn time to prevent players from gaining too much of an advantage from health and armor refills by re-collecting the item too fast
	- Diner: slightly lowered gamma factor of the light map and added `_minlight` to brighten dark spots
	- Jail: replaced temperature scale textures with pressure scale textures on the gas bottles and replaced weight scale textures with temperature scale textures on the ventilation 
- FIXED
	- Fatal crash when starting a new match from the main menu after exiting an arena and returning directly to the main menu
	- KillerDucks attacking frozen players and stacking up in FT
	- Disconnected clients dropping the freeze power-up in FT, which allowed others to collect the item, run around, and shoot while appearing frozen
	- KillerDucks movement to prevent them to stack and get stuck
	- KillerDuck disappears from the match if thrown into a nodrop area in CTKD
	- The neutral lolly would not respawn when the carrier died inside a nodrop volume brush
	- SprayKiller and SprayGod bonus scores not visible in first-person view, they are now drawn next to the spray scores and not above the payers head
	- Cvar `bot_minplayers` not working as intended in some game types
	- Missing `qer_editorimage` path in `textures/pad_wop/padtele` shader
	- Diner: two weapon markers spawning at Boaster/Betty position (fallen chair) causing z-fights
- REMOVED
	- Weapon makers from mapobjects folder; don't set weapon markers as misc_model entities, use the `marker` key in weapon entities instead
	- Fall and damage sounds when falling from higher heights, since WoP does not have fall damage
	- `fall1` sounds from player models and partially reused them as death variant sounds for alternate skins of a player model
	- `g_ft_useWeaponSet` and `g_ft_weaponSetAmmoRatio` modifiers because this feature was broken in FT and rather unused.
	- `cg_ft_thawerIconX` and `cg_ft_thawerIconY` FT thawer icon position cvars 
	- Cabin from the server map rotation and selection menu for CTKD game mode because bots cannot reach the KillerDuck item on the shelf
- UPDATED
	- SDL to version 2.32.8
	- Code base to [ioq3 1.36 Git cc18246](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3/commit/cc18246f22ab033e1b17af4616a68e9ea2e873db) with associated features and bug fixes
