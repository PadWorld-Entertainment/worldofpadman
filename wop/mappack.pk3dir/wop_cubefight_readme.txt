Features of the map
--------------------
This map was never intended for release and was only meant to show another 
mapper things about the map layout. I didn't think it would be a very good 
map, but it turned out to be a very fast duel map with very low ammo for 
dynamic game play.

Miscellaneous:          I license my own work (map file) under GPL 3.0. In 
                        particular, I demand that any new map based on mine 
                        must include its map file!
