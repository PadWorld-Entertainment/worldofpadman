//////////////-[ Description ]-\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

I just talked to [HEART] from the PadCommunity (hi btw) the other day about maps that were "so bad that they are good again" and about the killbox maps for HL2DM from back then. So I decided to try create something similar for WoP.

FragBox is just that. 

A big box with stuff for fragging other people with. 
It tosses everything out regarding balancing or sensible ideas.

It looks basic, it plays awful and its only intention is to cause chaos while playing it with a enough number of players.

Everyone spawns with a PadShield, BubbleG and Pumper.

I hope it's at least somewhat enjoyable! 

Will this map ever get any further updates? 
Hahaha, no.

Anyways, have fun fragging!
