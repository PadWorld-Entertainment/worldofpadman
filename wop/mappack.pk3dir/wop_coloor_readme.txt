--- Coloor for WoP by 3aTmE! ---

About the Map:

	Originally created in the summer of 2008 in 2 days over a weekend for WoP 1.2, I had already forgotten about this map until 
	I recently found it on Ben's server. Since it was barely playable due to missing textures, I decided to port it to WoP 1.6.
	The map file in this pk3 stands under the GPL v3.

Gametypes: 

	Free For All, Team Free For All and Last Pad Standing.

Weapons:

	PUMPER, BETTY, BALLOONY, SPLASHER, BOASTER and BUBBLE G.

Items:

	PADSHiELD, PADSHARDS, ViSiONLESS, REViVAL und PADPOWER.

Thanks to:

	Thanks to Fokoli and Toxic Avenger for checking the map and telling me if everything was okay. 
	Ben, for hosting my old map that I thought was long forgotten. The Brain, for helping me with 
	the license and the arena file.

Greetings to:

	Sauerbraten, McH, Hectic, Toxic Avenger, Pada, Fokoli, Iltis and all the other people which
	I had the pleasure to play with. :)
