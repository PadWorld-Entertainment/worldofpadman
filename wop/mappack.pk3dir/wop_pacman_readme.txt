Legal information
-----------------

Pac-Man is a game from 1980, developed by Namco. The rights to the name and 
game are owned by Midway Games!

Miscellaneous:          I license my own work (map file) under GPL 3.0. In 
                        particular, I demand that any new map based on mine 
                        must include its map file!

                        A community works by helping each other,
                        I hope this is a decent contribution.

Special thanks to Namco, who at a time when most people knew nothing about 
computers, created a megahit that is still probably the most popular game of 
all time.

Many thanks to ENTE and the WoP team for this outstanding game!
