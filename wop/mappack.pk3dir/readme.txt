Miscellaneous:          I license my own work (the files hec_werkstatt.map and
                        hec_werkstattbb.map) under the GPL 3.0. In particular I
                        demand that a new map which uses parts of my map has to
                        include its .map file aswell!

                        A community works through mutual help, I hope this is a
                        decent contribution.
