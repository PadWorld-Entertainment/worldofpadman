Readme for my map "Fly or Die"
=============================================================

Map name:              Fly or Die
Author:                BuddyFriendGuy
Supported game types:  FFA, LPS
Bot support:           Limited -- bots can't fly well anyway
License:               GPL-3.0
Size of the map:       x/y/z: 2048 x 2048 x 2464 units

Features of the map
--------------------------
Hectic's Jump'n'Run inspired me to make maps that help players improve specific 
skills. This map features FLOATERs. Players will spend most of the time in the 
air fighting with each other. In short, there are:

    Big empty space for pure Kung Fu fighting,
    easy rechargeable FLOATERs for continuous air fight,
    and easy rechargeable weapons.

(Do a crouch if you get stuck in the initial position.)

Motivation
----------
I suck at graphics. It took me forever to draw something and to put elements 
in place. However, I believe in community power. I do a little bit onto some
other people's work, and then somebody else adds a little bit more, and 
together we can create something nice and fun.

You are encouraged to improve my map: a better balance, a better trap 
design, a better positioning of elements, etc. I am not a very fast mapper,
but you can leave your suggestions for me in the WoP forum (my ID is 
BuddyFriendGuy there), or make your maps and share them.

You can also extend the concepts of focusing on specific skills in the game.
These are some ideas:

    A map in which only Punchy (or any other single weapon) is allowed,
    to force players to really work on that skill.

    A map with lots of PadPower and iMPERiUS, so users can throw each other 
    off their course.

    A map full of unavoidable Speedy and lots of lava, so users can work on 
    better controls.

    A map with long-lasting revival so it's not about killing each other,
    but who can find something or get to somewhere first, and when that
    happens, the world either collapses, or the winner triggers tons of 
    shooters to end the game.

    Etc.

Thanks
------
Thanks a lot to ENTE and the WoP Team for this brilliant game!

Special thanks to Hectic for patiently answering TONS of my questions during game plays,
and for not going after me for using his README file structure.

Thanks to The Brain for helping me with various questions with mapping in Linux.

I haven't seen saha around lately, but I want to thank him for convincing me that mapping 
is even possible for somebody like me. 

And also thanks to all the fun players in the game for all the great time.
