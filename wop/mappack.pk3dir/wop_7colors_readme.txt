Features of the map
--------------------
This map is for the Tournament mode and was originally designed to be 
played with iMPERiUS, but this went wrong and the weapon was removed 
from the map. Even though WoP does not officially support Tournament 
mode, this map is fun to play in Free For All mode.

Miscellaneous:          I license my own work (map file) under GPL 3.0. In 
                        particular, I demand that any new map based on mine 
                        must include its map file!

                        I hope this is a decent contribution.
