Features of the map
--------------------------
The map contains cannons to slingshot players of your team into the enemy base. One player has
to enter a cannon, another player has to pull the trigger. If the player in the cannon crouches
down, he will fly very close to the enemy's lolly. ;-)

                        that any new map based on mine must include its map file!
