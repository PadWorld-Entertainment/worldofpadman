Features of the map
--------------------
The model was the map "The Vast and Furious" by ButterB, who kindly provided 
his map file as a template for other maps. Important information can be found 
below in the "bubctf1-src" section!

His map file made the conversion from Q3 to WoP possible. Due to the different 
game dynamics of WoP, I made some changes to the map. The item distribution is 
completely different from the original and some of the jumppads have been 
modified.

After accidentally compiling with the wrong parameters, I saw how good the map 
looks without a sky light and with activated flares. So I quickly added a dark 
version of the BB and CTL versions. I then did the same with the FFA version of 
the map, removing the light versions of the maps due to lack of player interest 
and to keep the pk3 file small.

Legal information
------------------
Miscellaneous:          I license my own work (map file) under GPL 3.0. In 
                        particular, I demand that any new map based on mine 
                        must include its map file!

                        A community works by helping each other,
                        I hope this is a decent contribution.

Thanks to
----------
The biggest thanks undoubtedly go to ButterB, who has generously released one 
of the best CTF maps for Quake 3 for free use! (see "bubctf1-src" section below).

Of course, thanks also go to ENTE and above all to the WoP team, who have long 
and persistently taken care of WoP.
