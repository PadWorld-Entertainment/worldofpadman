About the map:

	Could not sleep the last night. Created this map to help me get asleep. (Did not really work since im writing this at 1am tho.)
	Very simple, sucky and bland. 
	But hey, it's something i guess.
	
	The .bsp and .map files contained are cc-0. Do the heck what you want to do with it.

	Does this count as map sh!tposting?

Gametypes: 

	Free for all, Team Free for all, Tourney, SyC, TSyC and Last Pad Standing.

Weapons:

	Pumper, Betty, Baloony, Splasher, Boaster and Bubble G.

Items:
	Padshield, Padshards, Visionless, Revivial, Visionless, Speedy and Padpower.

Installation:

	Open the .zip file and throw it in your /wop folder. Feeling shame for playing this crap is optional.


Big Thanks to:
	
	Kai-Li, Ben and Adri{HUN} for providing feedback! <3
